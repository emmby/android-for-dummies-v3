<!-- A view group that will hold our fragment and our toolbar.  Order
     is important: The first item in the FrameLayout will be laid out
     first, and the last last. This means that the views at the top
     of the FrameLayout will be under the later views.
     Technical stuff: this FrameLayout can be replaced with a merge tag

    <!-- This FrameLayout is an "anchor" that the Fragment will be placed
         into.  It will take up the entire screen.  Unlike in
         activity_task_list, we do not use the <fragment> tag here because
         we do not want android to auto-instantiate the fragment for us.
         Instead, we will manually instantiate it so that we can pass
         in parameters to the non-default constructor (specifically,
         the ID of the task to be edited). -->

    <!-- Our Toolbar view, which will be placed at the top of the screen
         and in front of our Fragment.  Most of its styling settings are
         defined in the AppTheme.NoActionBar style in our styles.xml,
         which we apply to this activity in AndroidManifest.xml. But
         we do need to add a little bit of buffer at the top of the
         screen to account for the status bar, since the status bar is
         translucent  content of the page has shifted up by a few pixels
         to slide under the statusbar. -->
